## Raven ##
Raven is a creative coding framework that combines ideologies seen in openFrameworks, Processing, and Flash, in a Javascript environment.
Classes are separated by their type, making it easy to pick which parts of the framework are needed for your project. While still in it's adolescence,
major changes are being made to accommodate for App-driven expansion.
